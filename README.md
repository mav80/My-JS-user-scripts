# My-JS-user-scripts
Here comes some of my javascript user scripts that changes the look of a few websites to my liking.

ArsTechnica-BetterQualityPictures.user.js - attempts to change pictures in the articles to their bigger resolution versions, where available

PCLab.pl-UnfoldNews.user.js - load all content of the news on the news page, no need to clik "more" button.

Joemonster-FixMainPage.user.js - removes old articles and boxes that looks like articles but are not from the main page. Affects only first page, page 2 and higher are unaffected.

Joemonster-FixArticlePage.user.js - this script attempts to unfold all comments (downvoted, long, more than 3 coments) on the article page. Currently buggy, may cause problems.
